Calculating gross profit
Gross profit is the amount of money you generated in sales minus the cost of selling those goods (Also know as Cost of Goods Sold or COGS). COGS does not include administration or marketing costs, only costs directly related to production or providing the good or service, so Gross Profit is a good metric to see the core profitability of any product\service.

GrossProfit=TotalSalesValueâˆ’TotalCOGS
Gross profit margin is the gross profit expressed as a percentage of sales, which is valuable for analysis and decision making.

GrossProfitMargin=GrossProfitSalesValue
As the manager of a factory, you have been asked to check the gross profit forecast for the following year.

Set sales and cogs variables to 8000 and 5400, respectively.
Using the formulas, calculate the gross profit gross_profit and print the gross_profit result.

# Set the sales variable to 8000
sales = 8000

# Set the cost of goods sold (cogs) variable to 5400
cogs = 5400

# Calculate the gross profit (gross_profit)
gross_profit = sales - cogs

# Print the gross profit
print("The gross profit is {}.".format(gross_profit))


# Set the sales variable and cost of goods sold (cogs) variables
sales = 8000
cogs = 5400

# Calculate the gross profit (gross_profit)
gross_profit = sales - cogs

# Print the gross profit
print("The gross profit is {}.".format(gross_profit))

# Calculate the gross profit margin
gross_profit_margin = gross_profit / sales

# Print the gross profit margin
print("The gross profit margin is {}.".format(gross_profit_margin))

Awesome! Did you know that a good gross profit margin varies by industry? For example a good margin in the automative 
industry might be 15%, but in another industry like apparel, the norm is around 50%. The higher margin you have the 
better of course, and also this margin will then pay for other expenses not directly related to the product, like Marketing. 
This will be covered in the next exercise, where we cover Net Profit
