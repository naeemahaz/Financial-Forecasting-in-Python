Calculating gross profit
Gross profit is the amount of money you generated in sales minus the cost of selling those goods (Also know as Cost of Goods Sold or COGS). COGS does not include administration or marketing costs, only costs directly related to production or providing the good or service, so Gross Profit is a good metric to see the core profitability of any product\service.

GrossProfit=TotalSalesValue−TotalCOGS
Gross profit margin is the gross profit expressed as a percentage of sales, which is valuable for analysis and decision making.

GrossProfitMargin=GrossProfitSalesValue
As the manager of a factory, you have been asked to check the gross profit forecast for the following year.

Set sales and cogs variables to 8000 and 5400, respectively.
Using the formulas, calculate the gross profit gross_profit and print the gross_profit result.

# Set the sales variable to 8000
sales = 8000

# Set the cost of goods sold (cogs) variable to 5400
cogs = 5400

# Calculate the gross profit (gross_profit)
gross_profit = sales - cogs

# Print the gross profit
print("The gross profit is {}.".format(gross_profit))


# Set the sales variable and cost of goods sold (cogs) variables
sales = 8000
cogs = 5400

# Calculate the gross profit (gross_profit)
gross_profit = sales - cogs

# Print the gross profit
print("The gross profit is {}.".format(gross_profit))

# Calculate the gross profit margin
gross_profit_margin = gross_profit / sales

# Print the gross profit margin
print("The gross profit margin is {}.".format(gross_profit_margin))

Awesome! Did you know that a good gross profit margin varies by industry? For example a good margin in the automative 
industry might be 15%, but in another industry like apparel, the norm is around 50%. The higher margin you have the 
better of course, and also this margin will then pay for other expenses not directly related to the product, like Marketing. 
This will be covered in the next exercise, where we cover Net Profit
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Calculating net profit
The net profit includes all the other costs (and all other income) that may incur or earn that is not directly related to the product.

For example the salary of the accountant who prepares your invoices, the advertising budget, travel expenses, etc.

So, how do we calculate this?

We start by setting a list for all the items that we want to include in the net profit calculation and calling the list "other operating expenses" or "opex".

To keep it simple we will not go into any tax or exceptional expenses or income.

The simplified calculation is:

NetProfit=GrossProfit−OtherOperatingExpenses

Add the appropriate variables into the opex list: sales, admin, travel, cogs, training, marketing, insurance.
Print the resultant list.
Calculate the net profit as the gross profit minus the total operational expenses. The gross_profit (gross profit) 
variable has been set for you.


# Create and print the opex list
opex = [admin, travel, training, marketing, insurance]
print(opex)

# Calculate and print net profit
net_profit = gross_profit - sum(opex)
print("The net profit is {}.".format(net_profit))

Great work! You now have a good understanding of the difference between net profit and gross profit, as well as what items to include in operating expenses. Sales minus cost of good sold minus operating costs gives you the net profit.

Great! That is correct! Costs not directly related to the production of goods should not be included in cogs, and subsequently not included in the gross profit.

Calculating sales
To calculate a sales forecast we need to know both the price we wish to sell our product and the number of units we expect to sell. In this example we will have a look at a company T-Z producing and selling T-Shirts.

The company offers its customers two options - a basic shirt or a customized shirt. A T-shirt costs 15 USD for a basic shirt, and 25 USD for a customized one.

T-Z have forecast orders for T-Shirts for delivery next month, and want to use the same sales mix of 60% basic and 40% customized. As this mix is relatively stable, we can calculate an average sales price per unit for T-Z. The variable forecast_units has been set for you.

Set the variables for the basic sales price as salesprice_basic, the extensive customization price as salesprice_custom.
Calculate the average sales price for the T-Shirts taking into account the sales mix
Calculate the forecast sales figure sales_USD for next month.
Print the total USD sales.
